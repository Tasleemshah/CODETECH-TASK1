/*so i have created a python program to find  the operations on the two chosen numbers.in the start of the program i have used while loop so that the operations will be performed on loop one after the another
i have then used a choice variable as an input from the user in order to select any one operation from the above ,after this if have used the if-else statement to check if my choice matches the condition then the operation 
will be performed otherwise it will automatically go in the else block and the program will be ended.for example if my choice is 1 then it will perform the addition operation and provide an output.*/

while True:

    print("1.Addition")
    print("2.subtraction:")
    print("3.multiplication:")
    print("4.division:")
    print("5.exit")

    choice=int(input("enter a choice:"))

    if choice in(1,2,3,4,5):
        num1=int(input("enter the first number:"))
        num2=int(input("enter the second number:"))

        if(choice==1):
            print("the addition of ",num1,"and",num2,"is",num1+num2)
        elif(choice==2):
            print("the subtraction of ",num1,"and",num2,"is",num1-num2)
        elif(choice==3):
            print("the multiplication of ",num1,"and",num2,"is",num1*num2)
        elif(choice==4):
            print("the division of ",num1,"and",num2,"is",num1/num2)
    elif(choice==5):
        break
